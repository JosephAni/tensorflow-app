# Tensorflow App

This is a simple app that uses the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library to understand transfer learning example using TensorFlow.js live in the browser.

Try it out, test it on a variety of objects, you may notice some things are harder to recognize than others, especially if they are similar to something else. You may need to add more classes or training data to be able to tell them apart.

## Recap

In this codelab I learned:

- What transfer learning is, and its advantages over training a full model.
- How to get models for re-use from TensorFlow Hub.
- How to set up a web app suitable for transfer learning.
- How to load and use a base model to generate image features.
- How to train a new prediction head that can recognize custom objects from webcam imagery.
- How to use the resulting models to classify data in real time.
